# CASA-Crowd: A Context-Aware Scale Aggregation CNN-Based Crowd Counting Technique.

1. I have used Shanghai Dataset.

2. You can download the dataset from : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tthien/shanghaitech-with-people-density-map)

3. I have trained till 40 epochs but I suggest you train fro atleast 500 epochs and do it on google colab for better and faster results.

4. My results and difference between my result and the final result in the paper is discussed in my presentation which I have uploaded. Do check that out.
